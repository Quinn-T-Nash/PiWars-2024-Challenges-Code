Code used for CNM Hackerspace PiWars 2024 Challenges where we placed first in Intermediate Division

The code is dependent on two different opensource githubs
-RedRobotics
https://github.com/RedRobotics/RedBoard

This was the base line for all of our movement and communication to the board and the motors.

-Pixy2
https://github.com/charmedlabs/pixy2

Pixy2 was used to give use access to our pixy camera and modify line tracking code to meet the goals of our challenges.
